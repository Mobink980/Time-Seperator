# Time-Seperator
A program that seperates two given times into several ranges written in C#
<p>In this program, we take two time intervals from the user: <br>
Start Time and End Time. <br>
The program will seperate the user's input into the ranges defined in the ranges array and will resul the output.<br>
This is an example of how it works:<br>
Ranges:<br>
00:00 - 06:00 <br>
06:00 - 08:00 <br>
08:00 - 24:00 <br>
  <br>
Enter the Start Time:<br>
3:23 <br>
Enter the End Time:<br>
2:50 <br>
<br>
03:23, 06:00 <br>
06:00, 08:00 <br>
08:00, 24:00 <br>
00:00, 02:50 <br>
</p>
